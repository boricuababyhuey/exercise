            I am a big fan of <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">Flavio Copes</a> so following his projects in the past, I have experience using <a href="https://astro.build/" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">Astro</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">Tailwind CSS</a>. So for this exercise I decided to use an empty Astro project with simple styling and Tailwind CSS and make a super simple webpage with the requested answers. I would have loved to get more in-depth with the project but am cut short for time.

            The biggest challenge I faced was spinning up a new GitHub instance as my local machine had some misconfigured git config files so I resorted to using GitHub Desktop to get this repository configured and authenticated.

        <p class="mb-8">
            I have used Netlify in the past for some projects and it is really simple to use. Admittedly I do not believe I have scratched the surface of all of the capabilities Netlify offers but the GitHub integration has worked seamlessly for me. I would say a feature that I have not used but has impressed me is the drag and drop deploy functionality. Netlify has a rich integration suite as well that seems like it would be exciting to support!

            As a disclaimer I am splitting hairs here as I am not against any of the activities as they are all vital in a well run support organization. My intent was to emphasize things I really enjoy (technical troubleshooting, learning new tools/technologies, helping others). I do not feel strongly against what I selected as my least favorite activies but for the sake of the exercise those came to mind.

            Admittedly this is coming from an extreme place of bias as I have had a major hand in this but my answer would be <a href="https://docs.ipdata.co" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">Ipdata's Developer Documentation</a>. Our aim was to make the documentation easy to understand, clean visually, with a lot of relevant examples for somone getting started with the Ipdata API.

            Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think are two major challenges around DNS configuration for less-technical customers hosting websites.
        </h1>

		<p class="mb-8">
            The first issue for a less-technical customer working with DNS configuration in website hosting is that DNS configuration is highly technical with a lot nuances. It is not something I would consider beginner friendly. Take for example the following configuration requirements from <a href="https://www.hivelocity.net/kb/dns-configuration-everything-you-need-to-know/" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">Hivelocity</a>. 
            There is a lot of DNS related terminology (TLD, A-Records, CNAME-Records etc.) and associated configurations that will cause a website to break if not configured correctly. Additonally, hosting providers vary and DNS configurations from a UI standpoint may or may not be as user friendly. In the case of Netlify there are additional <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">configuration steps</a> that must be done if your domain is externally registered.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
            The second issue here is that DNS propagation takes time up to 72 hours and this can lead to customers thinking their setup is not correct when the issue at hand is just propagation time. I have seen examples of support tickets create for this style of issue quite often for differing platforms.

            A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won’t build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site’s source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How would you troubleshoot this issue? What steps would you take? Also, please compose your best customer-facing first response.

        <h6 class="text-xl mb-10 font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Initial thoughts</h6>

		<p class="mb-8">
            For this particular issue given the circumstances we are going to have to probe the user for more information. We can lead in with sharing our findings in the build logs but we will need to request additonal information. Ideally we can either reproduce the issue or have the user check if their build logs produce more infromation i.e. this example I found on the <a href="https://answers.netlify.com/t/failed-during-stage-building-site-build-script-returned-non-zero-exit-code-2-netlify/73339" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">support forums</a> due to the instance of a private source repository. I also wonder if <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/troubleshooting-tips/#organization-owned-private-repository" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">this scenario</a> is relevant.

            Hello user,
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
            This is Edwin with Netlify support. As I understand you are encountering an issue with your site build. Given that your are integrating with Netlify using a private repository we have a limited visibility in your website and it's configuration. We have access to a paired down version of your build logs and we found the following error <code>Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code</code>.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
            As a next step, on your end may you provide a full copy of the build logs? This will enable us to take a deeper dive into the specific error(s) encountered. If you are able and willing we would be happy to review your configuration including your build configuration, associated scripts, and dependencies. If you are able to give us more insight in to the frameworks/tools used or make the repository public/or share a local copy we will be happy to review your setup further.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
            We look forward to your reply!
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl mb-10 font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900">
            How would you set up an http 301 status redirect from “/netlify/anything” on your site, to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything. Please provide the redirect formatting here. Now, how about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy redirect rule directly to your site.
        </h1>

		<p class="mb-8">
            Based on the following <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/" class="text-lime-800 hover:underline">guide</a> there are a few ways to accomplish this. One would be to create a <code>_redirects</code> file in your root folder. An example of how this would look is.
